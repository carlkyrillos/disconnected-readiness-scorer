# disconnected-readiness-scorer

Score a repository's readiness for deployment in disconnected / air-gapped OpenShift environments.

## What it does

Scans a repository for common patterns that break disconnected deployments:

1. **Image manifest completeness** — every container image referenced in code must appear in the CSV `relatedImages` or disconnected-helper manifest.
2. **Digest enforcement** — image references must use `@sha256:` digests, not mutable tags.
3. **Runtime egress detection** — flags code that makes outbound HTTP calls at runtime (as opposed to build time).
4. **Python dependency validation** — ensures pip/import targets are available from bundled mirrors, not PyPI/GitHub.

## Usage

```bash
claude plugin install disconnected-readiness-scorer@opendatahub-skills
```

Then from the root of any RHOAI component repo:

```bash
/disconnected-score
```

### Options

- `--rules all` (default) — run all rules
- `--rules csv,tags` — run only specified rules
- `--fix` — attempt auto-remediation where possible (e.g., replace image tags with digests)
- `--report markdown` — output a markdown report (default)
- `--report json` — output machine-readable JSON

## Output

```
Disconnected Readiness Score: WARNING

  BLOCKER  csv-relatedimages    2 images in code missing from CSV relatedImages
  PASS     no-image-tags        All 14 image references use digests
  WARNING  no-runtime-egress    1 HTTP call in pkg/controller/sync.go:142 — verify it uses mirror config
  PASS     python-imports       No unbundled Python dependencies found

Blockers: 1 | Warnings: 1 | Passed: 2
```

### Score levels

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **READY** | All rules pass |
| **WARNING** | No blockers, but warnings need review |
| **NOT READY** | One or more blocker-level failures |

## Rules

### csv-relatedimages-complete

Parses Dockerfiles, Helm charts, kustomize overlays, Go/Python source, and YAML manifests for container image references. Compares against:

- `spec.relatedImages` in the ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)
- The disconnected-helper image manifest (if present)

Any image found in code but missing from both lists is a **blocker**.

### no-image-tags

Scans all image references for tag-based refs (`:latest`, `:v1.2.3`). Tags cannot be reliably mirrored — only digest refs (`@sha256:...`) are guaranteed to resolve in a disconnected registry.

Production manifests with tags: **blocker**. Test/dev manifests with tags: **warning**.

### no-runtime-egress

Scans Go, Python, and TypeScript source for patterns indicating outbound network calls:

- Go: `http.Get`, `http.Post`, `http.NewRequest`, `net.Dial`
- Python: `requests.get`, `urllib.request`, `httpx`, `aiohttp`
- TypeScript: `fetch(`, `axios`, `http.request`
- Shell: `curl`, `wget` in scripts executed at runtime

Build-time usage (Dockerfiles, Makefiles, CI scripts) is excluded. Runtime usage where the URL is configurable/mirrorable is a **warning**; hardcoded external URLs are a **blocker**.

### python-imports-bundled

For Python projects, checks:

- `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` for packages not in the known-mirrors catalog
- Runtime `pip install` or `subprocess` calls that fetch from PyPI/GitHub
- `git+https://` dependencies in any requirements file

Unbundled runtime dependencies: **blocker**. Unbundled dev/test dependencies: **warning**.

## Configuration

### config/known_mirrors.yaml

Lists approved internal registries and PyPI mirrors. The scanner treats any image pull or pip install targeting these as safe.

```yaml
registries:
  - registry.redhat.io
  - brew.registry.redhat.io
  - quay.io/opendatahub
  - quay.io/modh

pypi_mirrors:
  - https://pypi.corp.redhat.com/simple/
```

### config/exceptions.yaml

Per-repo rule exceptions for known false positives.

```yaml
exceptions:
  - repo: opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard
    rule: no-runtime-egress
    path: frontend/src/utilities/fetch.ts
    reason: "Uses cluster-internal API proxy, not external egress"
```

## Integration

- **CI**: Add as a GitHub Action or GitLab CI job. Fails the pipeline on blocker-level findings.
- **Org Pulse**: Scores are reported to the dashboard alongside Agent Ready scores.
- **Agent Ready synergy**: Shares the same rule-engine architecture. A repo can run both Agent Ready and Disconnected Readiness as part of the same CI step.
